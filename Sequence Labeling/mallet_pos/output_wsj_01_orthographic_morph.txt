The DT

As s IN

a DT

emasculate VB

It PRP

not RB

The DT

As s IN

Yet RB
Section ion NNP

Thus s RB
, ,
with IN
one CD

in IN

the DT

under eror IN
Article NNP

Section ion NN
605 CD
also RB
imposes s VBZ
unconstitutional al JJ
conditions s NNS
on IN
the DT
president NN
's s POS
ability y NN
to TO
nominate VB
candidates s NNS
of IN
his s PRP$
choosing ing NN

The DT
language NN
of IN
the DT

implies s VBZ
that IN
any y DT

to TO
any y DT

of IN
a DT
rejected ed VBN

will MD
result VB
in IN
the DT
president NN
being ing VBG
denied ed VBN
funding ing VBG

that DT

's s POS

The DT

could MD
probably ly y RB
not RB
avoid VB
this s DT
restriction ion NN
by y IN
choosing ing VBG
people NNS
willing ing JJ
to TO
serve VB
without IN

, ,
because IN
the DT
Anti-Deficiency y NNP
Act NNP
prohibits s VBZ
voluntary y JJ
service NN
to TO
the DT
government ment NN
. .

The DT
1990 CD
appropriations s NNS
bills s NNS
also RB
contain VBP
a DT
number eror NN
of IN
`` ``
muzzling ing JJ
'' ''
provisions s NNS
that WDT
violate VBP
the DT
recommendation ion NN
clause NN
in IN
Article NNP
II NNP
of IN
the DT

Muzzling ing JJ
provisions s NNS
, ,
which WDT
might MD
be VB
called ed VBN
`` ``
blindfold NN

'' ''
as s IN
well RB
, ,
prevent VBP
the DT
executive ive JJ

from IN
even en RB
looking ing VBG
at IN
certain JJ
policy y NN
options s NNS
, ,
let VB
alone RB
from IN
recommending ing VBG
them PRP
to TO
Congress s NNP

Such JJ
laws s NNS
violate VBP
the DT
provision ion NN
in IN
Article NNP
II NNP
that WDT
requires s VBZ
the DT
president NN
to TO
make VB
recommendations s NNS
to TO
Congress s NNP
, ,
but CC
which WDT
gives s VBZ
the DT
president NN
the DT
discretion ion NN
to TO
select VB
the DT
subject JJ
matter eror NN
of IN
those DT
recommendations s NNS
. .

Typically ly y RB
, ,
these DT
laws s NNS
seek VBP
to TO
prevent VB
executive ive JJ

officials s NNS
from IN
inquiring ing VBG
into IN
whether eror IN

make VBP
any y DT
economic ic JJ
sense NN
or eror CC
proposing ing VBG
more JJR
market-oriented ed JJ
alternatives s NNS
to TO

Probably ly y RB
the DT
most RBS
egregious s JJ
example NN
is s VBZ
a DT
proviso NN
in IN
the DT
appropriations s NNS
bill NN
for eror IN
the DT

office NN
that WDT
prevents s VBZ
the DT

from IN
subjecting ing VBG
agricultural al JJ

There EX
is s VBZ
something ing NN
inherently ly y RB
suspect JJ
about IN
Congress s NNP
's s POS
prohibiting ing VBG

from IN
even en RB

being ing VBG
wasted ed VBN
in IN
some DT

or eror CC

Perhaps s RB
none NN
of IN
the DT
unconstitutional al JJ
conditions s NNS
contained ed VBN
in IN
the DT
appropriations s NNS
bills s NNS
for eror IN
fiscal al JJ
1990 CD
better eror RBR
illustrates s VBZ
Congress s NNP
's s POS
attempt NN
to TO
usurp VB

power eror NN
than IN
Section ion NN
609 CD
of IN
the DT
executive-office NN

: :
`` ``

The DT

's s POS
decision ion NN
in IN
INS NNP
v. CC
Chadha NNP
held VBD
that IN

the DT

If IN

President NNP

By y IN

though IN

If IN

unworkable ble JJ
because IN

leave VB

could MD
sign VB
the DT

The DT

However eror RB

As s IN

that WDT

merely ly y RB
because IN

The DT

of IN

in IN

would MD
be VB
a DT

by y IN
exerting ing VBG

to TO

that WDT

There EX

If IN

If IN

( (
assuming ing VBG

In IN
that DT

If IN

One CD
such JJ

an DT
